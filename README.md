# Compiler-in-C
This repo contains an implementation of a compiler in the C language. It consists of three files: Lex, Yacc, and a C file. The Lex file holds the regular expressions for lexical analysis, Yacc contains the grammar, semantic rules, and error functions. Finally, the header file is a C file that contains the headers of functions in the program.
